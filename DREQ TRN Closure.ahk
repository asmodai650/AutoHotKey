Description: 	This macro denies pre-invoice active claims. The reason MUST be Contractual > Refund Written Incorrectly.
		The note entered on the denial is "This UID has been closed in the client system due to client process. This claim should be denied.".

Requirements: 	This macro requires an excel spreadsheet labeled �NO LONGER PPN.xls�. It requires the AIM Claim ID in
		Column A and the denial amount in Column B. Currently an adjustment would be needed depending on
		the denial reason needed and the note needed.

Starting Inst:	Make sure that Safari is running but all claims are closed. Safari should be maximized on one
		screen and Excel should be maximized on your other screen. The spreadsheet should be called
		"No longer PPN.xls".

Time per claim:	TBD
